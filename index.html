            <h2 class="title">10. Tucker and Dale vs Evil</h2>
            <p>
                What to say about this movie. I think it is the fact that this movie plays on the fact 
                we judge people way to quickly. How it is shot is like have two separate eyes. The 
                hillbillies just have the worst luck that comes off so hysterical I always end up 
                dying because of my laughter. Yeah it is a B rated movie but its is one of my favorites 
                to turn on when I want to laugh. Its one of my favorite movies to show to people who 
                have never heard of them movie

            <h2 class="title"> 9. The Raid</h2>
            <p>
                    The Raid is a pure action flick from Indonesia. You get a very little back story 
                    in the beginning to the main character you are gonna be following but once the action 
                    starts its pure action and nothing is held back. Reading up on this movie it was awesome 
                    learning that these actors who did all the fighting scenes had to learn how to hit 
                    someone without it hurting. Making the contact real on screen but not to the point of 
                    hurting the other actor. Unlike American films that shoot action in so many cuts. These 
                    fight scenes are long and do not have many cuts. So the action is in your face and keeping 
                    you at the edge of your seat the whole time.

            <h2 class="title">8. Evil Dead 2</h2>
            <p>
                I love all movies and tv shows about the Evil Dead But if I had to choose one 
                that was my favorite. It would be Evil Dead 2. It was a short retelling of the 
                first movie but Sam Rami added dark humor and with Bruce Campbell going crazy in 
                this movie. Makes it a joy to watch the deadites come in and try to kill Ash. Ash 
                is a joy to watch function in all his movies

            <p>
                    Out of all my movies this is the only musical. I remember when I first 
                    saw this movie, I had no idea this was a musical. I was at my friends 
                    house and first song came on I looked at him. He said just you wait man. 
                    So, I waited and was drawn in my Depp performance. I can watch this over 
                    and over and not get tired of the music. I honestly know all the songs and when 
                    I do watch it, I sing it or sing it in my head so I do not rembarrasses myself.

            <p>
                This will not be my only Edgar Wright movie on here. Just from the opening shots 
                with the music to the way the camera work was. This movie is so brilliant with its 
                characters and camera work. Edgar Wright did not disappoint with this movie. When this 
                movie came out on digital, I bought it and it was on repeat for a week. Could not get 
                enough of soundtrack and story.

            <h2 class="title">5. Raiders of The Lost Ark</h2>
            <p>
                My father sat me down to watch this movie shorty after showing me the Star Wars Trilogy. 
                I did not know what I was in for. Then the boulder scene happened and I remember my jaw 
                dropping. Even today when that scene comes on, I feel like a kid. The melting face was
                probably too much for my young eyes, but I could not have enough. Seeing Indy go on 
                adventure and beat up the bad guys makes me feel like a child all over again.

            <h2 class="title">4. John Carpenters The Thing</h2>
            <p>
                I saw this movie when I was a child and was terrified of the practical effects. 
                I have seen this movie so many times and I love it. The gruesomeness of the monsters is
                awesome. This movie will never get old and its one of my favorites to show to people 
                who have never seen the movie.

            <h2 class="title">3. Scott Pilgrim vs The World</h2>
            <p>
                There is so much I can say about this movie. I can quote this movie almost perfectly. 
                Again, it is an Edgar Wright film and he made it his own. He integrated the comic books 
                and movie together in a beautiful way. Michael performance of Scott is downright hilarious. 
                This movie when it came out was a day one purchase and is always on repeat 
            </p>

            <p>
                I saw this movie 7 times in theater. I am a huge Joker fan and seeing him on screen 
                portrayed by Ledger was jaw dropping. The story even thou I have seen it over a hundred 
                times always grips me. Nolan did an amazing job on this movie. Everything is perfect

            <h2 class="title">1. Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back</h2>
            <p>
                Best sequel movie of all time. My father sat me down to show me the trilogy when I was a 
                child and I fell in love immediately. Growing up I pretended everything was a lightsaber. 
                When I sat on my grandfather ATV, I was in the forest of Endor. Everything I did when I was 
                a child I related it to Star Wars. But this movie the story, camera work, music, everything 
                is perfect. I replay this movie so many times I had a permeant ring on my DVD
